# ocaml-raytracinginoneweekend

Re-implementation of Ray Tracing in One Weekend (https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend) in OCaml

This implementation is quite dumb and there's a lot of room left for improvement...

## How to run

```
ocamlopt -o main main.ml
./main > out.ppm
```

It takes a long time. Be patient.
